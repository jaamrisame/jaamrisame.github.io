While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=shuichi-aizawa--anime-planet>Shuichi AIZAWA | Anime-Planet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shuichi-aizawa--anime-planet>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.anime-planet.com/images/characters/shuichi-aizawa-1346.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.JS_Evg9hhFWgkmdSrJOaYAAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Shuichi AIZAWA | Anime-Planet"><p><em>Source: anime-planet.com</em></p><blockquote><p>aizawa shuichi planet anime.</p></blockquote><p>Differences Between Anime and Western Animation: Animation generally has a lighter mood while WesternAnimation is more serious.
